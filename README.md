How to use website

The screen mirrors the layout of the keyboard. If you press on a box, a certain sound will play. If you press the corresponding key in the actual keyboard, the same sound will trigger and play. Once you open the website, (https://mikocotoner.github.io/), there is an "Open Modal" clickable text which is a pop up instruction incase you forget.

# Evaluation Report

 [**Survey**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FGWnxr0EJiOJaWW8qvLVouS9vBvQXEcCrs5czGKKzEo/edit#responses)

**Members:** _Monique Borje, Bien Marco Jorvina, Bozhidar Sabahov, Melvin Cotoner, Hifza Javed_

# What questions were you trying to answer with the various methods of evaluation you chose?

**Contributor - Melvin Cotoner** \
From our own observations and responses from the users&#39; survey, we asked ourselves if the
design of the project sufficed, if it was eye-catching at first glance and if it was an
eye-sore over time. As for any website design, it is important for the developers to know
the user&#39;s opinion on their work. Whether it be positive or negative, criticism should be
welcomed and acknowledged. Since this is only our prototype, these criticisms are critical
to delivering our final product. Having an eye-catching website is great to attract more users
but the question arises if it was easy for the eyes over a longer period of time or if it
gave discomfort.

Secondly, in our survey, we wanted to know the user&#39;s experience with our website. Was it
easy to use? Did they experience any issues during their testing of the website? Are there
certain features they would like to see added or removed? These questions can only be
fulfilled by the users. We made our website as simple as possible, ie, click on the box
to play that box&#39;s sound, otherwise press the corresponding key in the keyboard. The only
issues that could arise would be the default sounds might not be appealing or they would
prefer to add their own sounds into it. Hence we ask if there&#39;s anything that the user wants
to see changed or left untouched.

Finally, it is always good to know if our website is worth a second try. Would the users
ever use it again? Their responses would indicate whether or not the initial prototype was
promising or not. Users who would not visit again are either not interested in the website
to begin with and/or dislikes the prototype we came up with.

# How did you conduct the evaluations (heuristic, user, etc.) and why did you choose each?
**Contributor - Hifza Javed** \
The evaluation was conducted through a survey form which was made of a SoundBoard Questionnaire. The questionnaire was built using google forms which allowed easy access for our users to answer it anywhere at any time over laptops, PCs, mobiles without any hassle. Google forms are hugely used to create surveys quickly and efficiently which helps collect diverse types of information in this case about the Soundboard. Google form allowed us to involve various types of questions such as short answers, paragraphs, multiple selections, verification boxes, several options and pull-downs giving us the opportunity to analyze feedback from many different angles.

We created a 3 to 4 minutes short customized survey form especially related to the soundboard application and thought of the questions which we wanted to be answered which will give us a deep in-depth detail about how much the soundboard was successful and if not what we needed to improve on. The questionnaire was separated into two main sections, &quot;Design&quot; and &quot;Functionality &amp; Usability&quot;  for focused responses with structure so the user knows what each section was about and how to approach its answer properly to make evaluation easier for us when investigating the information. The questionnaire was open to users who gave responses to the survey and each response was collected in our google form for us to look in detail.

Each response was kept anonymous for our users to feel more comfortable answering without being judged and with honesty and as much detailed possible. Once we had all the responses we went through the summary of the responses which were given in the text, pie charts and bar charts which contributed to quick and efficient realization and analyzation of what our user taught of our soundboard. Responses were available to be viewed as summary or individual feedbacks so we had better evaluation taken from both methods of different user tastes v/s general user feedback.

The main idea behind conducting the questionnaire was to receive detailed answers for each question and let us as a group discover aspects of soundboard we can improve on.
evaluating our soundboard application on how our users found it and what improvements can be made also on what we went wrong on, it gave us an idea of what our users were looking for and what they were interested in and whatnot.

The questionnaire was built on google forms for multiple reasons:

- It is a free online tool that lets you build survey questionnaires within minutes. You only need a google account for it.
- Easy access(mobile friendly) and simple to use for our users to answer the questions. Any user with even an average knowledge of technology can simply use it anywhere anytime.
- The design was chosen to suit our Soundboard theme colours to give it consistency.
- Google forms stored all of the feedback given and we were able to analyze that information in detail which helped us with our product evaluation.
- A customized form of personal questions related to the product according to the answers we were looking for, not a sample or made up questionnaire. Customized soundboard survey.
- Analyze through the summary of responses v/s individual responses.

# What did you learn from the evaluation? As in: What did users think? What worked, what didn&#39;t. What, if anything, did you learn from the heuristic evaluation?
**Contributor - Monique Borje** \
**Design**

 The general reaction received from the users who tested the SoundBoard was the lack of knowledge on what the site was about. One of the user states &#39;I was a little confused, but that&#39;s probably because I didn&#39;t know what the purpose of the site was.&#39; The users wanted an Introduction of what the Soundboard is about and what you can use it for. From this, we learn that the majority of the users would want a brief description of the Soundboard.

The users impression on the color palette was mixed. One states having difficulty reading the font with the colors used especially on &#39;rap&#39; row of the SoundBoard which is in a green monochromatic scheme. We also asked the users how they would describe the level of eye comfort when using the SoundBoard for a long duration of time and one user comments on how &#39;pink color would become tiring&#39;. Two users suggested a dark mode feature which is an excellent alternative for users who may experience discomfort when using it in its current state. Light text on a dark background would minimise the eye strain for those users who prefer working in dark mode.

The keyboard layout was confusing to the users and they did not realise that it mimics an actual keyboard on their computer. It took them awhile to figure out why it was displayed in that manner. &#39;I noticed that the layout had the same layout as the rows on a keyboard, but that was only after a bit of messing around. Maybe that could be made a little clearer.&#39;

**Functionality and Usability**

 From the user experience evaluation, the users found the website easy to use and understand. Although we have a popup window for Instructions &quot;Click on the pads or use your keyboard to play sounds.&quot; The users were quick to adapt to the environment and was able to figure out how to activate the sounds on the SoundBoard. When the users were asked on their overall feel of using the controls, one user says &quot;the controls feel intuitive and responsive&quot; which meant that it was straightforward when using the keyboard however, the hover only changed color when using the manual click button on the pad. The user suggests that the button pressed on the keyboard should also do something in order to differentiate the buttons pressed from all the other buttons.

 When asked for features they wished to be included or removed, the users brought up the brief description once again which highlights the importance of informing the users on what the product is for. One users also suggested to have samples of the work produced using the Soundboard which could show them how other users created a piece of music using the SoundBoard. This would encourage them to experiment with their own style and imagination.

Overall, only Â¼ of the users decided they didn&#39;t want to use the SoundBoard again. The rest of them are willing to try and use it in the future. The users rated an average of 8/10 which is a generous rating considering the lack of description and instructions. The most critical information we discovered from the user evaluation was how an information and or a brief description is essential to a users understanding of an overall product. Therefore, if we were to produce another application, we will keep the importance of that in mind.

# User interface improvements
**Contributor - Bien Marco Jorvina** \
Having conducted the evaluation using the method described above, we have received some invaluable feedback from the participants regarding the current state of the user interface and the general functionality and usability of our project. We also received suggestions on features which should be added to the website to further enhance the user experience.

- The questions from the &quot;Design&quot; section of our survey directly targets what the user think of how the website looks. From this section the feedback we received are primarily focused on the user interface. There was a trend among the responses which showed that the users&#39; first impression of the website consisted of confusion and ambiguity. They initially did not know what the purpose of the website was. This is a crucial flaw in the way information is portrayed on the website, or the lack thereof. To solve this pivotal subject with elegance and ease, we can simply add an initial prompt when loading the website which displays the instructions on how to operate its features on a popup window along with an intuitive virtual representation of a keyboard to also show what keys they can and cannot use.
- The general feedback we received regarding the color palette we used on the website was positive. The users found the aesthetic of the website pleasing to the eye with suggestions to make minor color changes pertaining to some of the higher contrast colors to softer ones. An additional question linked to the color palette was the user&#39;s expected eye comfort for the usage of the website for an extended period of time. The users reciprocated that with the minor color changes in mind, they would feel comfortable using the website for an extended period of time.
- The layout of the buttons proved to be a &quot;pretty cool&quot; subtle feature of the website, closely resembling the actual layout of the keys on the keyboard. However, it was not directly obvious to the user that this was the intention. Adding a simple message or a popup reminder as suggested in the first bullet point would solve this issue.
- The user&#39;s found the SoundBoard to be quite responsive and feel good for the most part with a small issue where the trigger animation for the pads on the soundboard would not show if the user uses the keyboard. This can easily be fixed to include animations when keypress is detected.
- The website proved to be quite easy to understand and very easy to use according to the responses however as pointed out by many, it is vital to acknowledge to the user that since this website is in the early stages and is regarded as a prototype, it must be made clear what functions and features are expected to be working and not. For example, we proposed to add a recording functionality to the website which will allow the user to put sounds on loop on different channels and record their track. At the current state of the project this is not yet implemented thus we should explicitly state with a clear and unambiguous statement that it currently does not work instead of making it look functional.
- As pointed out by the responses, our project would greatly benefit from the addition of the feature of enabling a dark mode theme. Dark mode is something greatly desired by our users so the addition of this feature is essential.
- Changes which we wish to implement which were not mentioned in the responses from the evaluation include: better responsiveness to different screen sizes, ui restructure for mobile users, adding customizability features to enable users to freely change the theme and color layou, adding a personalised user account and being able to export user made tracks.

# Looking back
**Contributor - Bozhidar Sabahov** \
The group didn&#39;t really have any particular project idea they wanted to do, so we just went with the first thing we came up with. A website that displays the layout of a keyboard, having each key play a unique sound was simple and sounded achievable. Some members didn&#39;t like the idea of the soundboard or even didn&#39;t know what a soundboard was. Choosing a project idea the whole group likes would make all stages of the exercise more motivating.



It goes without saying that more time to prepare and more time to spend working on the project is obvious in our work. If we had more discussions and made meetings more regular, it would have helped us get the work done faster, and also even add in more features. Having better time management would mean we would have more time to conduct proper surveys and evaluations. Proper delegation of work and imposing deadlines to each member would have helped give better structure to the software development stages instead of last minute planning and rushing. Exercising proper software development methodologies would also help us enforce responsibilities and to simulate a &quot;work&quot;  or a more professional environment.
